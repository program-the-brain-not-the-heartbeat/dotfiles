# Matt's Docfiles

## Quickstart

To quickly download and install these dotfiles into a new server, copy/paste the following command:

`bash <(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/program-the-brain-not-the-heartbeat/dotfiles/main/bootstrap.sh)`

The bootstrap command will git the repo and install the files into the user account's home directory.

## Todo

- XDG folder structure
- Work/Personal profile and input on installing
